I HAVE NO WORDS TO THANK DIO (DIGITAL INNOVATION ONE) FOR ALL THEY'VE DONE FOR ME AND HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF OUR BRAZILIAN COMUNITY
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING, PROGRAMMING, LEARNING PATHS, BOOTCAMPS, FROM BASIC TO ADVANCED COURSES IS DUE THEIR EFFORT TO BRING ANYONE THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY @LEARNING CODING. BUT ALSO, SOFT SKILLS, ENTREPENEUAR BASIS, CONNECTING STUDENTS WITH JOBS OP.

WELL, THIS CURRENT PROJECT HAS BEEN SO KIND OF CHALLENGING. 
I'LL STILL HAVE TO DEBUG TO FIND SOME ISSUES ON IT. 
AS SOON AS I FIX IT IT'LL BE READY TO PLAY
